Ideas
	Platformer character that inherits functions from previous lives. eg. At first the character can only run. When it dies you get a descendant with a mutation such as jumping
or attacking. Go on like that until you are able to beat the level. Try to do it in as few generations as possible.
	Tokyo Jungle style game where players "mate" with various characters to combine the abilites of their character and the other one.

Hypotheses
	Inhereting abilities from your previous lives will allow players to solve levels using novel solutions due to their unique skill sets
	Solving world problems by combining the traits of two characters to create a new character
